# VControlHub i18n Coverage Report

> Generated: 2026-07-10T14:22:45.476Z | Files: 358 | Strings: 0 | Coverage: **100%** (0/0)

This report cross-references hardcoded Chinese strings in `src/app/**/*.tsx` and `src/components/**/*.tsx` against the values in `src/lib/i18n/translations.ts`. A string is **covered** when its exact value already exists in the `zh` translation map; **missing** strings are candidates for new translation keys (or for relocation to the `dom-bridge` runtime substitution system).

Strings inside `data-i18n-skip` regions, in `<script>` tags, or in JSX expressions (`{...}`) are not audited.

## Module coverage (lowest first)

| Module | Strings | Covered | Missing | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Top missing strings (frequency-sorted)

Each row is a Chinese string that appears in source but has no matching key in `translations.ts`. Add the string as a `zh` value, then optionally provide an `en` value, then reference via `t("<key>")` or the `dom-bridge` data-i18n system.

| String | Count | First 3 occurrences |
|---|---|---|

## Files with missing translations

_None — every Chinese string in TSX is already covered by `translations.ts`._
